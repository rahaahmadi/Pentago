# Pentago
The game is played on a 6×6 board divided into four 3×3 sub-boards. Taking turns, the two players place a marble of their color onto an unoccupied space on the board, and then rotate one of the sub-boards by 90 degrees either clockwise or anti-clockwise.
A player wins by getting five of their marbles in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row.
